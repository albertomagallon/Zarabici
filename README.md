Bike management


A national company that is dedicated to the rent of bicycles has asked us to make a web application, but before we must make the database.

This application must manage bicycles, stations (stations are made up of anchors), routes, partners, employees, repairs of bicycles, stations (a bike repair is only made by an employee, but a season repair can be done by several operators ).

Each office (one per province) has its own rates, and each partner can pick up a rate, where the rates are monthly, quarterly, annual, etc. When you finish a fee you can buy another one, the first purchase of a fee will have to be in the office since the associate will be provided with a card with which he can rent, the following renovations can be by web.

We want to know how many kilometers a bike has done, the km will be introduced by the application.

We want to get to know what we have invoiced for real bonds, that is, a rate may change price the following year but the user we have charged before the rise, also when hiring a rate will put the time that ends the bond, when Buy the voucher we will calculate the final date starting from the date the voucher is purchased and the days of which the voucher is made, with this happens as with the rate, if the days of the tariff are changed, the user will not be seen affected.

An anchor has a status indicating whether it is in operation or if it is broken.
In addition an anchor can be occupied or not by a bicycle.

Of the routes we want to know where it has started, where it has finished, with which bike, and which user, both the start time and the end time.

We must allow users to introduce incidents, the text is free, but if we want to know which associate has introduced.
